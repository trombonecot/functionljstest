Write a function processParagraph that, when given a paragraph string as its argument, checks whether this paragraph is a header. If it is, it strips off the '%' characters and counts their number. Then, it returns an object with two properties, content, which contains the text inside the paragraph, and type, which contains the tag that this paragraph must be wrapped in, "p" for regular paragraphs, "h1" for headers with one '%', and "hX" for headers with X '%' characters.

Â¶ Remember that strings have a charAt method that can be used to look at a specific character inside them.
